I want an app that will have exactly the same features as splitpro (https://github.com/oss-apps/split-pro) but in java stack as described below.

The design of the app will be light and modern. 

The app will need a login and 2 step authentication. It will have a admin section to manager the users and settings.

The stack of the app will be:

- In java
- Maven
- Spring boot
- Embeded jetty

I will edit the code in eclipse if needed.

The goal is to run this app in a docker container.

Can you build it ?
